# Streaming-ETL-Pipeline-using-Kafka

#### The project aims to decongest the national highways by analyzing the road traffic data from different toll plazas. Each highway is operated by a different toll operator with different IT setups that use different file formats. 

#### As a vehicle passes a toll plaza, the vehicle's data like vehicle_id,vehicle_type,toll_plaza_id, and timestamp are streamed to Kafka.  

#### The job is to create a data pipeline that collects the streaming data and loads it into a database.
